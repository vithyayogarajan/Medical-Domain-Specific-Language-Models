## Data and Labels 

Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) is one of the most extensive publicly available medical databases. It contains de-identified health records of 49,785 adult patient admissions and 7,870 neonates admissions in critical care units at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. [MIMIC-III Clinical Database](https://physionet.org/works/MIMICIIIClinicalDatabase/access.shtml)

The electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) is a database formed from the Philips eICU program, which is a telehealth program delivering information to caregivers and, as a result, enhancing patient care. It contains de-identified data for more than 200,000 patient admitted to ICUs in 2014 and 2015 and monitored by programs across the United States. [eICU Database](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/)
